## These two functions together serve to store the inverse matrix in cache.
## The first function creates a "matrix" - a list of functions that serve to operate with matrix and with its invertion.
## The second function searches for inverse for a "matrix" specified by argument.
## If the inverse hasn't been calculated yet, it will be calculated and stored to cache.

## Function makeCacheMatrix takes a "matrix" as an argument. After that, the inv variable is set to NULL value,
## because the inversion hasn't been calculated yet.
## The function returns a list of 4 functions to operate with a matrix and its inverse

## Function cacheSolve takes a "matrix" (created by makeCacheMatrix function) and tries to set the value from cached data
## if this operation is succesfull (an inverse has already been calculated), than the message "getting cached data" is displayed
## and function returns an inverse matrix from cahce. 
## In the opposite case, function checks if the input matrix is square. If it's not the case, message about mistake is displayed
#and NULL value is returned (and also saved in cache)
## if the matrix is square, the inverse matrix is calculated using solve() function, the result is saved in cache and also
## returned by the funcion.
